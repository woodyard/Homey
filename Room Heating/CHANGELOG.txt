Author: Henrik Skovgaard
Created: 2025-12-31
Based on: Clara Heating v6.4.6

==============================================
Version 10.8.3 (2026-01-17)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: TADO target must be recalculated from scratch on air settle
- Fixed bug where TADO was still set to wrong temperature (18.1°C instead of 22°C)
- Problem: effectiveTarget variable had been modified by away mode logic earlier in function
- Using modified effectiveTarget resulted in wrong temperature when resuming after window settle
- Solution: Start fresh with slot.target when resuming, then apply away/inactivity logic cleanly
- Now calculates: slot.target → apply away min (if away) → apply inactivity offset (if inactive)
- Example: slot.target=22°C, away min=18°C → if away then 18°C, if home+inactive then 20°C
- Ensures TADO gets absolutely correct temperature on first attempt when air settle completes
- Next script run will not need to correct the temperature

==============================================
Version 10.8.2 (2026-01-17)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: TADO set to wrong target temperature after air settle delay
- Fixed bug where TADO was set to incorrect temperature when window settle delay completed
- Problem: Inactivity offset was applied AFTER TADO was resumed, not before
- Window settle logic ran before inactivity logic in code flow
- Result: TADO resumed with base target (22°C) instead of effective target (e.g., 20°C with -2°C offset)
- Example: Room inactive → window closes → wait 10 min → TADO resumed at 22°C (wrong!)
- Should be: Room inactive → window closes → wait 10 min → TADO resumed at 20°C (correct!)
- Solution: Calculate effective target (including inactivity offset) before resuming TADO
- Now applies inactivity offset immediately when air settle completes, before setting target
- Smart plug behavior unchanged (already correctly calculated in hysteresis logic)
- Ensures TADO gets correct temperature immediately when heating resumes

==============================================
Version 10.8.1 (2026-01-17)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: "Air settled" notification not sent after window settle delay
- Fixed bug where "Air settled • Heat resumed" notification was not sent for TADO valves
- Problem: After window settle delay completed, code continued executing instead of returning
- TADO heating was resumed correctly, but notification changes were cleared/overridden
- Solution: Added explicit return 'window_settled_tado' for TADO valves after air settle
- Smart plugs continue to hysteresis logic (correct behavior - need to check temperature)
- Affects: TADO valve rooms (Oliver, Soveværelse, Stue) - now get proper notification
- Smart plug rooms (Clara) - behavior unchanged (already working correctly)
- Ensures users are notified when heating resumes after window closed delay

==============================================
Version 10.8.0 (2026-01-17)
==============================================
🎛️ Unified slot-override architecture
- Introduced unified getEffectiveSetting() function for all slot-based overrides
- All settings (inactivity, window timeouts) now use same override pattern
- Slot values take precedence over room defaults when defined
- Added getSettingSource() helper for logging override source ('slot override' or 'room default')
- Replaces multiple ad-hoc override checks with consistent pattern
- Documentation: See UNIFIED_SLOT_OVERRIDE_ARCHITECTURE.md and UNIFIED_SLOT_OVERRIDE_SYSTEM.md
- Settings supporting slot overrides: inactivityOffset, inactivityTimeout, windowOpenTimeout, windowClosedDelay
- Benefits: More maintainable, consistent behavior, easier to add new overridable settings

==============================================
Version 10.7.0 (2026-01-17)
==============================================
⏱️ Per-slot inactivity timeout support
- Added slot-level inactivityTimeout override capability
- Each schedule slot can now define custom inactivity timeout (overrides room default)
- Example: Night slot with 5min timeout, Day slot with 30min timeout
- Stored in global variable: SlotInactivityTimeout (null if using room default)
- Displayed in status showing effective value and source (slot vs room)
- Documentation: See SLOT_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_FEATURE.md
- Complements existing slot-level inactivityOffset override
- Enables fine-grained control over inactivity behavior per time period

==============================================
Version 10.6.13 (2026-01-16)
==============================================
🐛 Fix: Schedule gap when Day ends before lateEvening starts
- Fixed bug where schedule had gap between Day end and lateEvening start on holidays
- Problem: Weekday Day ends 20:00, but lateEvening starts 21:00 (when no school tomorrow)
- Gap from 20:00-21:00 would use default slot (first Morning slot) instead of extending Day
- Solution: If lateEvening starts later than last base slot ends, extend last slot to match
- Example: Weekday Day (06:00-20:00) auto-extends to (06:00-21:00) when using lateEvening
- Only affects holiday/vacation days when school tomorrow = false
- Ensures smooth schedule transitions without unexpected temperature changes

==============================================
Version 10.6.12 (2026-01-16)
==============================================
🔕 Suppress "air settled" and "heat resumed" notifications when in away mode
- "Air settled • Heat resumed" notifications are now suppressed during TADO away mode
- These notifications are not relevant when nobody is home
- Functionality unchanged - only notification suppression during away mode
- Log still records event with "(away mode - notification suppressed)" indicator

==============================================
Version 10.6.11 (2026-01-15)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Window settle delay triggered even for brief window openings
- Fixed bug where "Window closed • Waiting 10min" shown even if window only open for seconds
- Problem: Air settle delay started whenever window closed, regardless of how long it was open
- If window open < timeout, heating never turned off, so no need to wait for air to settle
- Solution: Only start settle delay if window was open long enough to trigger heating shutoff
- Example: Open window 5 sec → close → no delay (heating never affected)
- Example: Open window 6 min → close → 10 min delay (heating was off, air needs to settle)

==============================================
Version 10.6.10 (2026-01-15)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Window closed delay notification sent immediately
- Fixed bug where "Air settled" notification appeared immediately after "Window closed"
- Problem: WindowClosedTime could trigger premature completion check
- Solution: Added minimum 60-second threshold to prevent immediate double notifications
- Ensures script MUST wait at least 60 seconds before "Air settled" notification
- Prevents both notifications from being sent with identical timestamps

==============================================
Version 10.6.9 (2026-01-15)
==============================================
🔍 Search child zones for motion and window sensors
- Added getZoneAndChildDevices() helper to search parent zone + all child zones
- Window sensors now detected in child zones (fixes "No window sensors found")
- Motion sensors now detected in child zones for proper activity tracking
- Supports complex zone hierarchies (e.g., "Stue / Spisestue" with "Stue" and "Spisestue" children)
- isWindowOpen() now searches child zones
- Backward compatible - works with both simple and hierarchical zone structures

==============================================
Version 10.6.8 (2026-01-15)
==============================================
📊 CRITICAL FIX: Use TADO device temperature sensor directly by ID
- Fixed bug where TADO devices in different zones weren't found by zone filtering
- TADO rooms now get thermostat directly by device ID instead of filtering by zone
- Prioritizes TADO's built-in temperature sensor (more accurate at valve location)
- Falls back to zone sensors if TADO device not found or lacks temperature capability
- Affects: TADO valve rooms (Oliver, Soveværelse, Stue) - uses thermostat temperature
- Smart plug rooms (Clara) unchanged - continues using zone sensors
- Added detailed logging showing which sensor is used and current temperature value
- Fixes "TADO device has no temperature sensor" false warning

==============================================
Version 10.6.7 (2026-01-14)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Away mode transition check MUST happen BEFORE manual detection
- Fixed execution order bug causing false positive manual override when arriving home
- Problem: detectManualIntervention() called BEFORE grace period reset in controlHeating()
- When arriving home: TADO auto-adjusts temp → manual detection checks (stale grace) → false positive
- Then too late: controlHeating() resets grace period (after damage already done)
- Solution: Moved away→home transition check to MAIN EXECUTION before manual intervention detection
- Now: Check away status early → reset grace if transitioning → THEN check for manual intervention
- Result: Grace period properly set before detection runs, preventing false positives
- Execution order: 1) Away check + grace reset, 2) Manual detection, 3) Control heating
- This ensures TADO's automatic away→home adjustments are protected by grace period

==============================================
Version 10.6.6 (2026-01-14)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: False positive manual override when returning from away mode
- Fixed bug where TADO rooms triggered manual override when arriving home
- Problem: TADO thermostats automatically adjust temperature when switching from away→home
- System compared new TADO target against stale away-mode ExpectedTargetTemp → false positive
- Example: Away at 18°C → TADO auto-adjusts to 20°C on arrival → detected as "manual" change
- Solution: Reset grace period timer (LastAutomationChangeTime) when returning from away mode
- 7-minute grace period prevents false detection during TADO's automatic adjustment
- Affects: TADO valve rooms (Oliver, Soveværelse) - smart plug rooms unaffected
- Prevents: "Home" notification → "Manual override" false positive sequence

==============================================
Version 10.6.5 (2026-01-14)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Grace period constantly reset causing false manual override detection
- Fixed bug where LastAutomationChangeTime was updated on EVERY script run, even when no changes made
- Problem: Script runs frequently (events: motion, window, schedule), constantly resetting grace period
- Grace period never actually expired, then suddenly did when timing aligned → false positive
- Between grace expiry, inactivity mode could toggle, changing target (21°C → 20°C with -1°C offset)
- System detected its own inactivity changes as manual intervention after grace expired
- Solution: Only update LastAutomationChangeTime when ACTUALLY making physical changes
- Also increased grace period from 2 to 7 minutes for additional safety margin
- Example prevented: "Air settled • Heat resumed" at 15:45 → "Manual override" at 15:50
- Grace period now properly protects against detecting automation's own temperature adjustments

==============================================
Version 10.6.4 (2026-01-14)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Clear expected target when TADO turned off
- Fixed bug where stale ExpectedTargetTemp values caused false positive manual override detection
- Problem: When TADO turned off, ExpectedTargetTemp was left with old value
- Later schedule changes would compare against stale expected value → false positive
- Example: System sets 20°C, turns off, schedule changes to 18°C → false "manual override"
- Solution: Clear ExpectedTargetTemp (set to null) when turning TADO off
- detectManualIntervention() already handles null values correctly (returns detected=false)
- Prevents: False manual override notifications when schedule changes while TADO is off

==============================================
Version 10.6.3 (2026-01-13)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: False positive manual intervention detection
- Fixed bug where system detected its own temperature changes as manual interventions
- Problem: When turning TADO off (window open), stored currentTarget as expected value
- This caused false positive when system later calculated different target (e.g., due to schedule)
- Solution: Only store ExpectedTargetTemp when actively controlling (turnOn=true)
- Increased grace period from 30 seconds to 2 minutes (scripts run every 5 min)
- Now ALWAYS updates LastAutomationChangeTime when storing expected target
- Added detailed logging to track when expected values are stored
- Prevents: "Override ended → Manual override" notification loop when window closes

==============================================
Version 10.6.2 (2026-01-13)
==============================================
🐛 CRITICAL FIX: Manual intervention detection not working when TADO already on
- Fixed bug where ExpectedTargetTemp was only stored when turning TADO on
- Now stores expected target on every heating control cycle (both on and off)
- Manual temperature changes now properly detected even when automation hasn't recently changed target
- Without this fix, manual intervention detection would fail if system was maintaining steady temperature
- Example: User changes Soveværelse from 21°C to 22°C now triggers manual override notification

==============================================
Version 10.6.1 (2026-01-13)
==============================================
🐛 Fix diagnostics logging during manual override mode
- Manual override now logs actual TADO target temperature instead of 0°C
- Diagnostics now show correct target (e.g., 22°C) instead of "Target: 0°C"
- Fixes misleading log entries during manual override

==============================================
Version 10.6.0 (2026-01-13)
==============================================
🤚 Add manual intervention detection and handling
- Detects manual temperature changes (TADO) and switch changes (smart plugs)
- Pauses automation for 90 minutes (configurable per room) when manual intervention detected
- Manual override has highest priority - cancels active boost/pause modes
- Auto-revert to schedule after timeout
- Cancel command now cancels boost, pause, AND manual override
- Boost/pause commands cancel manual override when activated
- Grace period (30 seconds) prevents detecting automation's own changes
- New global vars: ManualOverrideMode, ManualOverrideStartTime, ManualOverrideDuration, etc.
- New functions: activateManualOverrideMode(), cancelManualOverrideMode(), checkManualOverrideMode(), detectManualIntervention()
- Tracks expected values to detect changes: ExpectedTargetTemp (TADO), ExpectedOnOff (smart plugs)
- Notifications when manual override starts, ends, and is active

==============================================
Version 10.5.0 (2026-01-12)
==============================================
⏸️ Add pause heating mode (opposite of boost)
- New "pause" argument: run('Clara', 'pause') forces heating OFF for 60 minutes
- Smart plugs: Turn off all radiators, ignore all conditions
- TADO valves: Turn completely OFF (onoff = false)
- Ignores temperature, schedule, window, inactivity, away mode during pause
- Latest call wins: pause cancels boost, boost cancels pause (mutually exclusive)
- Cancel command now cancels both boost and pause modes
- Automatic revert to schedule after 60 minutes
- New global vars: PauseMode, PauseStartTime, PauseDuration
- Notifications when pause starts, ends, and is active
- New functions: activatePauseMode(), cancelPauseMode(), checkPauseMode(), controlHeatingPause()

==============================================
Version 10.4.4 (2026-01-09)
==============================================
🐛 Fix next schedule showing wrong day type
- getNextScheduleChange() now correctly determines tomorrow's schedule type
- Friday evening no longer shows "School" when Saturday uses weekend schedule
- Properly checks if tomorrow is weekend/school day/holiday
- Shows actual first period from tomorrow's schedule, not today's
- Example: Friday 20:27 now shows "Night" (weekend) not "School" (weekday)

==============================================
Version 10.4.3 (2026-01-08)
==============================================
🔧 Fix Flow argument parsing
- Homey Flows pass "Clara, boost" as single string (not separate args)
- Script now splits comma-separated arguments automatically
- Works with both: Flow "Clara, boost" and HomeyScript run('Clara', 'boost')
- Example Flow input: "Clara, boost" or "oliver, cancel" (case-insensitive)

==============================================
Version 10.4.2 (2026-01-08)
==============================================
🔧 Make room names case-insensitive
- Can now use 'clara' or 'Clara', 'oliver' or 'Oliver'  
- Fixes "Unknown room" error when using lowercase names
- Example: run('clara', 'boost') works same as run('Clara', 'boost')

==============================================
Version 10.4.1 (2026-01-08)
==============================================
🛑 Add cancel boost function
- New "cancel" argument: run('Clara', 'cancel') cancels active boost
- Immediately clears boost mode and resumes schedule
- Notification sent when boost is cancelled
- Works even if boost not active (safe to call anytime)

==============================================
Version 10.4.0 (2026-01-08)
==============================================
🚀 Add boost heating mode
- New "boost" argument: run('Clara', 'boost') activates boost for 60 minutes  
- Smart plugs: Turn on all radiators, ignore schedule and hysteresis
- TADO valves: Set to 25°C boost temperature
- Ignores window open, inactivity, away mode during boost
- Automatic revert to schedule after 60 minutes
- New global vars: BoostMode, BoostStartTime, BoostDuration
- Notifications when boost starts and ends

==============================================
Version 10.3.11 (2026-01-08)
==============================================
⏳ Add window closed delay for air to settle
- New setting: windowClosedDelay (seconds, default 600 = 10 minutes)
- After window closes, heating waits before resuming
- Allows air to mix and settle for accurate temperature reading
- Prevents heating from working harder due to cold air near sensor
- New global var: WindowClosedTime tracks when window was closed
- New action: 'window_closed_waiting' during settle period
- Notification shows "Window closed • Waiting Xmin" then "Air settled • Heat resumed"

==============================================
Version 10.3.10 (2026-01-05)
==============================================
📱 Fix snowflake icon appearing when TADO is IDLE
- Snowflake (❄️) now only shows when heating is OFF, not IDLE
- IDLE is normal for TADO - means valve is on but not actively heating
- "OFF" = heating completely turned off (e.g., window open)
- "IDLE" = heating ready but room at target (no icon needed)

==============================================
Version 10.3.9 (2026-01-03)
==============================================
🛠️ CRITICAL FIX: Double checkInactivity() call caused wrong notification target
- checkInactivity() was called twice: once in controlHeating(), once before notification
- Between calls, zone could become active (e.g., person closing window)
- Second call returned different results, causing notification to show wrong target
- Example: TADO set to 20°C (with inactivity), but notification showed 21°C (no inactivity)
- Fix: Use stored EffectiveTemperature and InactivityMode flag instead of rechecking
- "IDLE" = heating ready but room at target (no icon needed)

==============================================
Version 10.3.8 (2026-01-03)
==============================================
📱 Changed window icon to wind icon
- Changed open window icon from 🪟 to 💨 (wind/draft)
- More intuitive - immediately suggests "air coming in from outside"
- Icons: 💨=window open, 💤=inactive, ❄️=heating off, 🚶=away mode

==============================================
Version 10.3.7 (2026-01-03)
==============================================
📱 Remove redundant temperature comparisons from notifications
- Removed "21.9 > 20.75°C" and "19.7 < 20.5°C" from heat on/off messages
- Temperature comparison is redundant (already shown in status: 🌡️21.9→20.5°C)
- "Heat on • 19.7 < 20.5°C" → "Heat on"
- "Heat off • 21.9 > 20.75°C" → "Heat off"
- "Inactive (20min) • -2°C → 20.5°C • Heat off • 21.9 > 20.75°C" → "Inactive (20min) • -2°C → 20.5°C • Heat off"

==============================================
Version 10.3.6 (2026-01-03)
==============================================
📱 Condensed change descriptions (Option 2 - More Condensed)
- "Window opened • Heating turned off (open 75 sec)" → "Window (75s) • Heat off"
- "Schedule changed to 06:00-20:00 • Target: 20°C → 22.5°C" → "Schedule 06:00-20:00 • 20→22.5°C"
- "No activity detected (20+ min) • Target reduced by 2°C to 20.5°C" → "Inactive (20min) • -2°C → 20.5°C"
- "Activity detected - resumed • Target restored to 22.5°C" → "Active • → 22.5°C"
- "Nobody home detected (TADO) • Minimum temperature set: 18°C" → "Away • Min 18°C"
- "Someone arrived home (TADO)" → "Home"
- All messages now more compact while remaining clear

==============================================
Version 10.3.5 (2026-01-03)
==============================================
📱 Use walking person icon for away mode (matches TADO app)
- Changed away mode icon from 🏠 to 🚶 (walking person)
- Matches TADO app's own away mode symbol
- Icons: 💨=window open, 💤=inactive, ❄️=heating off, 🚶=away mode

==============================================
Version 10.3.4 (2026-01-03)
==============================================
📱 Icon-only alerts - removed all text after icons
- Icons are now standalone, self-explanatory symbols
- 💨 = window open
- 💤 = room inactive
- ❄️ = heating off
- 🚶 = away mode
- Ultra-clean, minimal notification format

==============================================
Version 10.3.3 (2026-01-03)
==============================================
📱 Condensed notifications - only show alert icons
- Window icon only shown when OPEN (not when closed)
- Inactive icon only shown when room IS inactive (not when active)
- Heating icon only shown when NOT heating (OFF/IDLE, not when ON/HEATING)
- House icon only shown when in AWAY mode (not when HOME)
- Result: Normal operation shows just temperature, alerts show relevant icons

==============================================
Version 10.3.2 (2026-01-03)
==============================================
📱 Compact notification format with icons
- Notifications now much more compact (3-4 lines vs 8-10 lines)
- Temperature display: "22.3→20°C" instead of separate lines
- Window: ✓ (closed) or ✗ (open) - removed redundant status text
- Inactivity: ✗ (active) or ✓ (inactive/sleeping)
- Heating: 🔥 for ON/HEATING, ❄️ for OFF/IDLE
- Added next schedule change time with target and period name
- All status on single line with icons for quick scanning

==============================================
🎯 Target-based temperature control (BREAKING CHANGE)
- Schedules now use single "target" temperature instead of low/high
- Smart plugs automatically calculate hysteresis range (±0.25°C default)
- TADO valves use target directly - handles heating power automatically
- Clearer configuration: "I want 22.5°C" not "low 22.25, high 22.75"
- Per-room hysteresis setting for smart plugs
- TADO always gets correct target (not away temp when just off)
- Simplified inactivity/away logic: target - offset
- Global vars: Temperature (target), TemperatureLow/High (calculated for smart plugs)
